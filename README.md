This version is in prototyping and requires PERMANENT MODIFICATION of the case to fit. However, it does function.
The plastic tab holding the cable entry down needed to be cut off. The PCB should be re-designed with a 'notch' where the tab is.

It has only been tested with a late thin-bezeled variant of the M122. The screw holes have a tight fit and may require widening and more clearance around them for traces.

I need to include test points at the end of each row and column, for testing continuity. Currently no copper is exposed except for at the connector, which makes it impossible for PCB manufacturers to continuity test the board and will likely lead to defects in large-scale production.

Capacitive pad measurements are taken from i$/idollar's FSSK and FEXT PCB designs, which I believe are directly measured from the original Model F PCBs.
There are very tiny unconnected copper dots in the void space within the capacitive pads that need to be removed from the footprints before manufacture. JLCPCB did this for me, but it is necessary to remove them beforehand.

JLCPCB also wanted to confirm with me that the backside isn't supposed to be filled with a ground plane. Adding one will probably be fine, but will likely make the board less flexible as a result.

The PCB thickness should be 0.6mm. This is thin enough to allow the board to flex into shape without preforming it with heat and duct tape (which I couldn't make work anyway).

Standard glossy soldermask is probably the best choice. JLCPCB has had issues with wear on their black soldermask before. They have changed the formula, but a standard green/red/blue/yellow/purple/white/etc. glossy solder mask is probaby the safest bet for keyswitch wear resistance.
Higher wear resistance might also be achieved by coating the front of the capacitive pads in silkscreen, as silkscreen is an extra layer of epoxy. I am unsure how this will affect keyfeel or actuation, however.

There is a bullseye circle on the front of the board. This is for drilling a hole for a trackpoint module. There are redundant traces to allow for safer drilling at this location, but this functionality has not been tested!

The diameter of the copper around the connecting pads could be to be enlarged. They are too fragile and I had one rip out when disconnecting a mill-max pin header connector (fortunately it was just a redundant ground).

For connecting the board to an xwhatsit or other controller, I would recommend 3M 8132/06 100, which has the correct pitch for this board and xwhatsit:

The key matrix of the PCB is reverse-engineered from photos of original F122 PCBs and should be exactly the same. The connector is likely in a slightly different position though.

The screw hole placement was prototyped with paper by printing an SVG output of the board edge cuts and drill holes on multiple sheets of paper, pasting them together, cutting out the paper 'PCB', and hole punching the drill hole locations. A few iterations of this paper prototyping method allowed me to test hole locations and board fitment against the barrel plate without having to make an entire PCB first.

I did not clad the steel backplate in tape before mounting the PCB. The solder mask should provide adequate isolation. Just make sure the steel is clean and there are no burrs/jagged edges that could scrape the PCB.
